        <h1><b>Semantic-Elements Learning</b></h1>
          <p>By reading the articles, semantic elements are use in HTML to describe 
          what is in the content of the code to browsers and developers.  
          Also it is important to know the semantic tags that are better to use 
          and will bring more attention to the web development community and the tags we should stop using in HTML.  
          Having standard semantic elements help search engines to find the correct content easier 
          and for developers to use better coding practices for simplicity.</p>
